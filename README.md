# AlexaOnNodeJS-Lambda

This file repo is the code used to build the server and code on the Lambda. This will allow you to integrate alexa to Plex, Tivo, and Sony Bravia. The code is really hacked together, but hopefully gives you an idea on how to do this. I will be cleaning up the code. 

I tried not to include any NPM modules and wanted my code to work on its own without any other modules besides the standard NPM core modules. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Again this code may or may not work, but gives you something to start with or understand how I integrated with various components. 

### Prerequisites

Node server to run the command node server.js

### Attribution

I forked this from jingsta.  Most of the code is his.  I just made some changes to make it work with my specific setup.  I also added encryption / authentication for the link between lambda and my home server.
